# project1

This project implements a simple flask based server application for a raspian pi (model 3b).

Connected to a pi camera (camera module 2), it serves a live stream accessbile via the browser from anywhere. 

Part of the implementation is a basic security mechanism to prevent unauthorized access, as well as a usb-drive based image storage.
